            I have experience building systems from scratch, usually from theory to implementation. I work on advanced power electronic systems, that includes design and control of power converters, using PCB Sltium software, programming with microcontrollers, embedded systems and MATLAB simulations. Experimental work includes soldering, testing devices (oscilloscopes, multimeter, etc) and hardware integration.

            In my journey, my interest always navigated me towards working on real-world problems using advanced technology such as GaN devices. My focus is on building Solid-State device based power converter system that is robust and targets to improve current technology. Alongside, I also work with improving my skills in software systems such as Altium PCB Designer, MATLAB Simulink, LTSpice and programming languages such as C, Python, and DSP microcontroller programming.
