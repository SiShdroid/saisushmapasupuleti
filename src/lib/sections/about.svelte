      My name is <span class="font-bold">Sai Sushma Pasupuleti</span>. I’m a PhD
      student in Electrical Engineering specializing in <span class="font-bold">Power Electronics</span>.
      I enjoy turning theory into working hardware and building robust, high-performance converter systems.

        I build systems end-to-end—from modeling and control design to PCB implementation and lab validation.
        My work includes power converter design and control, embedded firmware development, and simulation in
        MATLAB/Simulink and LTspice. On the hardware side, I design PCBs in <span class="font-semibold">Altium Designer</span>
        and validate prototypes using standard lab equipment (oscilloscope, DMM, power supplies, electronic loads, etc.).

        I’m especially interested in <span class="font-semibold">wide-bandgap (GaN/SiC)</span> power systems and solid-state
        converter architectures that push efficiency, power density, and reliability. My current focus is developing
        solid-state device–based converter platforms that improve performance and robustness compared to conventional designs.

      <p class="mt-8 text-sm leading-normal text-slate-400 sm:text-base">
        Tools and skills: Altium Designer, MATLAB/Simulink, LTspice, and programming in C/C++ and Python (including DSP/microcontroller workflows).
        I’m continuously expanding my skill set through research, hands-on prototyping, and experimental testing.
